Genetic testing company Blueprint Genetics uses the latest technologies\n        and techniques to help healthcare professionals around the world to\n        diagnose and treat rare genetic conditions. Service is fast, affordable,\n        and comes with informed, actionable insights.\n      </p>\n    </Chapter>\n    <ImageRow>\n      <Image thumbSrc={ photo1Thumb } src={ photo1 } alt=\"Blueprint lab\" />\n      <Image thumbSrc={ photo2Thumb } src={ photo2 } alt=\"Blueprint lab\" />\n    </ImageRow>\n    <Chapter>\n      <h4>The bright idea</h4>\n      <p>\n        In 2011, three Finnish post-docs in Stanford had an idea about a new\n        sequencing technology that could bring genetic testing to mainstream\n        healthcare. What if something that began as a research project could be\n        transformed into a successful, growing business with a large set of\n        commercial products and services all supported by modern digital\n        solutions that are equipped to handle massive amounts of human genetic\n        data?\n      </p>\n    </Chapter>\n    <Chapter>\n      <h4>The inevitable challenge</h4>\n      <p>\n        A growing business means a growing need for software development talent,\n        so Blueprint Genetics got in touch to find out if our experienced\n        developers and scrum coaches could help their entire team – from business\n        stakeholders and domain experts to product owners and individual\n        developers – learn about Scrum best practice and help to improve their\n        products.\n      </p>\n    </Chapter>\n    <Image thumbSrc={ photo3Thumb } src={ photo3 } alt=\"Blueprint lab crew\" />\n    <Chapter>\n      <h4>Our solution</h4>\n      <p>\n        We kicked off the partnership in 2017 by rolling up our sleeves for the\n        daily development work while at the same time coaching the Blueprint\n        Genetics team to help them sharpen up their software development\n        practices in terms of technologies, communication, and leadership.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We helped to set up a development process where everything starts from\n        business and operational needs and decisions are made based on\n        prioritisation and workloads. We also pitched in on building an\n        architecture that’s capable of handling ever-increasing amounts of data\n        in real time. We also helped to develop a new production process for\n        analysing sequenced DNA samples and reduce process lead times.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As workload increases alongside business growth, it is crucially\n        important to maintain open and transparent ways of working, employing\n        best practices and maintaining good cooperation between development teams,\n        day-to-day operations, different stakeholders, and users. As well as\n        helping with practical matters on the software development side we\n        helped Blueprint Genetics scale up by empowering their teams to take even\n        greater leaps forward both in their development processes and the volume\n        of analyses their pipelines could handle.\n      </p>\n    </Chapter>\n    <ImageRow>\n      <Image thumbSrc={ photo5Thumb } src={ photo5 } alt=\"Blueprint lab\" />\n      <Image thumbSrc={ photo6Thumb } src={ photo6 } alt=\"Blueprint lab\" />\n    </ImageRow>\n    <Chapter>\n      <h4>So how did it go?</h4>\n      <p>\n        Blueprint Genetics is a great example of finding business success in a\n        lean start-up way: quick experimentation with new ideas, short\n        development cycles, and fast commercialisation have led to fast business\n        growth.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The turnover of Blueprint Genetics has more than doubled annually during\n        our co-operation. The amount of data Blueprint Genetics gathers is today\n        counted in petabytes and they utilise considerable amounts of computing\n        power. We also helped take development culture forward and recruit new\n        team members.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Blueprint Genetics appreciated our hard work, open communication and\n        ability to take improvements forward.\n      </p>\n    </Chapter>\n    <Image thumbSrc={ photo4Thumb } src={ photo4 } alt=\"Blueprint pic\" />\n    <Chapter>\n      <h4>Success that speaks for itself</h4>\n      <p>\n        Thanks to the new ways of working we’ve introduced and our contribution\n        to software development, work at Blueprint Genetics is now more\n        transparent, agile, and efficient. We created a solid platform for\n        Blueprint Genetics to continue their great growth and success. The\n        collaboration with two modern and fast-paced company was a success for\n        everyone involved.\n      </p>\n    </Chapter>\n    <Summary>\n      <Image src={ summary } alt=\"Blueprint summary\" />\n      <h4>The challenge</h4>\n      <p>\n        Growing business meant a growing need for software development talent, and\n        the knowledge of Scrum to help the entire team from business stakeholders\n        and domain experts to product owners and individual developers to learn\n        the best practices and help to improve the products.\n      </p>\n      <h4>The result</h4>\n      <p>\n        We helped in the daily development work while at the same time coaching\n        the Blueprint Genetics team to help them sharpen up their software\n        development practices in terms of technologies, communication, and\n        leadership.\n      </p>\n    </Summary>\n  </Fragment>\n)\n"]}
